Acentiex ERC20 Token V1.0

(ACTX)
Project will start off as an ERC20 smart contract token based off of the Ethereum Platform.  We will then swap our ERC20 Acentiex Token 1:1 for the new Acentiex POS Coin based off of PIVX & DASH Masternodes.  We are currently working to build a strong everlasting team that plans to stick around for the life of the project.

Our whitepaper is currently being written by jaytechdesigns.com and will be done by September 1st.  Please check back often for updates and come join us on all Acentiex social media platforms to get the latest news on our progress.  If you would like to join the team, contact us here or find us on one of the social media accounts listed below.
